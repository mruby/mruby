## What's mruby

mruby is the lightweight implementation of the Ruby language complying to (part
of) the [ISO standard][ISO-standard].  Its syntax is Ruby 1.9 compatible.

mruby can be linked and embedded within your application.  We provide the
interpreter program "mruby" and the interactive mruby shell "mirb" as examples.
You can also compile Ruby programs into compiled byte code using the mruby
compiler "mrbc".  All those tools reside in the "bin" directory.  "mrbc" is
also able to generate compiled byte code in a C source file, see the "mrbtest"
program under the "test" directory for an example.

This achievement was sponsored by the Regional Innovation Creation R&D Programs
of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan.

## Note for License

mruby has chosen a MIT License due to its permissive license allowing
developers to target various environments such as embedded systems.
However, the license requires the display of the copyright notice and license
information in manuals for instance. Doing so for big projects can be
complicated or troublesome.  This is why mruby has decided to display "mruby
developers" as the copyright name to make it simple conventionally.
In the future, mruby might ask you to distribute your new code
(that you will commit,) under the MIT License as a member of
"mruby developers" but contributors will keep their copyright.
(We did not intend for contributors to transfer or waive their copyrights,
Actual copyright holder name (contributors) will be listed in the AUTHORS
file.)

Please ask us if you want to distribute your code under another license.


## How to Contribute

non-exclusive right to your contributed code under MIT license.  If you want to

file in your pull request.
