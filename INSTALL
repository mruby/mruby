* Prerequisites

  1. Make sure you have bison (http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) installed in
     your system.
  2. Make sure you have ruby installed in your system (required to build).


* Compilation and Installation

  1. Run make in the top directory.

     This command will create a build directory with a directory for the host
     environment and one for each crossbuild environment based on the settings
     in the build_config.rb file.

     Assuming a default build, each of the environment directories will have
     the following important directories:

       * bin - The binary executables for this environment
       * lib - The libraries for this environment

     You can find the header files in the include directory at the root of the
     project.

     You can directly invoke 'minirake' with the following command:

         $ ruby ./minirake

If an error occurs when compiling mruby, it will be helpful for others if you
send a detailed report to the developers that includes the error log, machine,
and OS type.


* Adding existing gems

Gems from the [list of mruby gems](http://www.mruby.org/libraries/) can be
added by adding their respective GitHub URLs to build_config.rb. For example,
to add implementations of the File and IO Ruby core classes to mruby, insert
the following in build_config.rb under the comment section `Use mrbgems`:

    conf.gem :git => 'git@github.com:iij/mruby-io.git', :branch => 'master'

Afterwards, re-run:

    ruby ./minirake


* Porting to other platforms

That's all.
