* Prerequisites
  
  1. Make sure you have bison (http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) installed in your system. 
  2 Make sure you have cmake (http://www.cmake.org version 2.8.8 or 
  later installed).
  

* Compilation and Installation

  1. Run cmake . ; make ; make install in the top directory.
     
  
     This command will create the following directories and
     store libraries and binaries files into them.

       * /usr/local/bin
       * /usr/local/lib
       * /usr/local/include

If an error occurs when compiling mruby, it will be helpful for others if you
send a detailed report to the developers that includes the error log, machine,
and OS type.


* Porting to other platforms


That's all.
