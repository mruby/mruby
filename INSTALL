* Prerequisites
  
  1. Make sure you have bison (http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) installed in your system. 
  2. Make sure you have ruby installed in your system (required to build).

* Compilation and Installation

  1. Run make in the top directory.

     This command will create a build directory with a directory for the host environment
     and one for each crossbuild environment based on the settings in the build_config.rb 
     file.

     Assuming a default build, each of the environment directories will have the following 
     important directories:

       * bin - The binary executables for this environment
       * lib - The libraries for this environment

     You can find the header files in the include directory at the root of the project.

     You can directory invoke 'minirake' as the following.

        $ ruby ./minirake

If an error occurs when compiling mruby, it will be helpful for others if you
send a detailed report to the developers that includes the error log, machine,
and OS type.


* Porting to other platforms


That's all.
